### Quick Start

> Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/HavocFramework/Havoc/wiki) for complete documentation.

Havoc works well on Debian 10/11, Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 and Kali Linux. It's recommended to use the latest versions possible to avoid issues. You'll need a modern version of Qt and Python 3.10.x to avoid build issues.

See the [Installation](https://havocframework.com/docs/installation) docs for instructions. If you run into issues, check the [Known Issues](https://github.com/HavocFramework/Havoc/wiki#known-issues) page as well as the open/closed [Issues](https://github.com/HavocFramework/Havoc/issues) list.

### RBAC, sessions, and audit logging

The teamserver now ships with role-based access control (RBAC) primitives and a built-in audit log.

- SQLite migrations seed a `default` workspace and default roles (`admin`, `operator`, `auditor`) with permissions for listener management, payload generation, and tasking. Existing databases are migrated automatically on startup; new deployments just start the server to create the schema.
- Operators defined in your profile are materialized into the `TS_Users` table with hashed credentials during bootstrap. Update the profile passwords and restart the teamserver to rotate credentials or insert fresh rows into `TS_Users`/`TS_UserRoles` for out-of-band rotation.
- Session tokens are generated after authentication and streamed to clients; they can be revoked by deleting rows from `TS_Sessions` or rotating the operator password.
- Audit events are persisted to `TS_AuditEvents` and broadcast to clients (see the **Activity & Approvals** tab in the Qt client). Each entry captures who performed an action, the target, and contextual metadata to support review/approvals.

### Note

Please do not open any issues regarding detection. 

The Havoc Framework hasn't been developed to be evasive. Rather it has been designed to be as malleable & modular as possible. Giving the operator the capability to add custom features or modules that evades their targets detection system.
